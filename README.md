# A Linguist's Obsidian Setup

_Here are the css snippets and the templates I use in Obsidian, as a linguist._

</header>

## Workflow

In order to make use of the snippets and templates, you need to know about my setup.

### Obsidian

My whole work setup revolves around [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).  I use a variety of plugins but the following are central:
- Calendar
- Commander
- Dataview
- Folder Note (Lost Paul)
- Hover Editor
- Interlinear Glossing
- Kanban
- List Callouts
- Pandoc Plugin
- Pandoc Reference List
- Tag Wrangler
- Tasks
- Telegram Sync
- Templater
- Zotero Integration

### Zotero

I use Zotero for all of my reading. I annotate everything I read in Zotero and then I import the annotations into Obsidian. I use a few plugin with Zotero :

- BetterBibTex
- DOI Manager
- Scite Zotero Plugin
- Zotero OCR
- Zotero Reading List

### Telegram 

On top of messaging, I use the telegram app on my phone to send notes directly to my Obsidian Vault


## Obsidian CSS Snippets

- Litnotes -> Styling options for my literature notes, to format what I bring from Zotero
